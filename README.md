- 👋 Hi, I’m @eeatty
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code as a suplement to curriculum design and K-12 teaching
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript with an eye towards Python next
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me solidify skills in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm particularly interested in anything that can be adapted for use with K-12 education for content areas other than CS.
- 📫 You can find me on Twitter @DahlingEmmi
